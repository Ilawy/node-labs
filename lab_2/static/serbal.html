            Mount Serbal (Arabic: Jebel Serbal, جبل سربال) is a mountain located in Wadi Feiran in southern Sinai. At
            2,070 metres (6,791 ft) high, it is the fifth highest mountain in Egypt. It is part of the St. Catherine
            National Park. It is thought by some to be the Biblical Mount Sinai. Among others this was claimed by Ludwig
            Schneller, because it fits best with the biblical tradition taking into account the route and speed of the
            Israelites and the surroundings of the mountain, as Rephidim is identified with Wadi Feiran.[2]
